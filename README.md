# DL4HBM-2020

This repository contains important functions, datasets and pre-trained architectures that are used in the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YLhzYRsMGn67EzFmSzKyMwXQaAMjxKfC?usp=sharing) created for the Deep Learning for Human Brain Mapping conference of 2020. 

The goal of the notebook is to familiarize the user with weakly supervised deep learning techniques. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in the notebook contains images of the axonal F-actin periodical lattice acquired using a super-resolution STED microscope. All images in the dataset were labeled using polygonal bounding boxes around the periodical lattice. More information on the dataset can be found on the [BiorXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.119453v1) version of our recent publication.
